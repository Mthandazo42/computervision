# Identify My Pet
Inspired by the Jeremy Howard's Deep Learning for coders course, identify my pet is a simple web application which asks the user to upload his/her pet's image and in return classify the breed of the pet.The web application was made using Scarlette and Uvicorn. A mobile version of this exercise is coming soon!!

# Running the App locally
Running the app is pretty much easy, you just have to install a couple of dependincies and use the app.

# Step One
Install all the necessary dependencies of this app by running the following command
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step Two
Whilst in the project root directory, run python app/server.py serve to start the uvicorn server. Open your browser and go to your https://localhost:5000 and start identify the breed of your pet.
